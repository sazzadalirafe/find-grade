# find-grade
Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:
Score Grade

Grade >= 0.9 = A

Grade >= 0.8 = B

Grade >= 0.7 = C

Grade >= 0.6 = D

Grade < 0.6 = F

If the user enters a value out of range, print a suitable error message and exit. For the test, enter a score of 0.85.
